# Introduction 
Welcome to the To-Do list which is a powerful task management tool which is  designed to help you keep track of your tasks and stay organized in your daily life.




# How To Use 
When you launch the application, you will be met with a welcome message and a menu of options. Select option 1 to add a task, then give a description (e.g., "Complete project report") and, optionally, a due date (e.g., "09/30/2023"). Your task will be put to your local to-do list and, isÂ synchronised with Google Sheets. To delete a task, select option 2, enter the task's index, and it will be removed from your list and Google Sheets, if applicable. Option 3 displays your current tasks together with their indexes and due dates, allowing you to keep track of your to-do list. Finally, option 4 allows you to exit the application once you've completed your tasks management.
